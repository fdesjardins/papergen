DESCRIPTION
       lp submits files for printing or alters a pending job.  Use a filename of "-" to force printing from the standard input.

   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS  provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST and PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither are set, the
       current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is used, followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.

OPTIONS
       The following options are recognized by lp:

       --   Marks the end of options; use this to print a file whose name begins with a dash (-).

       -E   Forces encryption when connecting to the server.

       -U username
            Specifies the username to use when connecting to the server.

       -c   This option is provided for backwards-compatibility only. On systems that support it, this option forces the print file to be  copied  to  the
            spool directory before printing.  In CUPS, print files are always sent to the scheduler via IPP which has the same effect.

       -d destination
            Prints files to the named printer.

       -h hostname[:port]
            Chooses an alternate server.

       -i job-id
            Specifies an existing job to modify.

       -m   Sends an email when the job is completed.

       -n copies
            Sets the number of copies to print.

       -o "name=value [ ... name=value ]"
            Sets one or more job options.

       -q priority
            Sets the job priority from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest).  The default priority is 50.

       -s   Do not report the resulting job IDs (silent mode.)

       -t "name"
            Sets the job name.

       -H hh:mm

       -H hold

       -H immediate

       -H restart

       -H resume
            Specifies  when  the  job  should be printed.  A value of immediate will print the file immediately, a value of hold will hold the job indefi‐
            nitely, and a UTC time value (HH:MM) will hold the job until the specified UTC (not local) time.  Use a value of resume with the -i option  to
            resume a held job.  Use a value of restart with the -i option to restart a completed job.

       -P page-list
            Specifies  which  pages  to  print  in  the  document.   The  list  can  contain a list of numbers and ranges (#-#) separated by commas, e.g.,
            "1,3-5,16".  The page numbers refer to the output pages and not the document's original pages - options like "number-up" can affect  the  num‐
            bering of the pages.

   COMMON JOB OPTIONS
       Aside from the printer-specific options reported by the lpoptions(1) command, the following generic options are available:

       -o media=size
            Sets the page size to size. Most printers support at least the size names "a4", "letter", and "legal".

       -o orientation-requested=4
            Prints the job in landscape (rotated 90 degrees).

       -o sides=one-sided
            Prints on one side of the paper.

       -o sides=two-sided-long-edge
            Prints on both sides of the paper for portrait output.

       -o sides=two-sided-short-edge
            Prints on both sides of the paper for landscape output.

       -o fit-to-page
            Scales the print file to fit on the page.

       -o number-up={2|4|6|9|16}
            Prints 2, 4, 6, 9, or 16 document (input) pages on each output page.

CONFORMING TO
       Unlike  the  System  V printing system, CUPS allows printer names to contain any printable character except SPACE, TAB, "/", or "#".  Also, printer
       and class names are not case-sensitive.

       The -q option accepts a different range of values than the Solaris lp command, matching the IPP job priority values (1-100, 100 is  highest  prior‐
       ity) instead of the Solaris values (0-39, 0 is highest priority).

EXAMPLES
       Print two copies of a document to the default printer:

           lp -n 2 filename

       Print a double-sided legal document to a printer called "foo":

           lp -d foo -o media=legal -o sides=two-sided-long-edge filename

       Print a presentation document 2-up to a printer called "foo":

           lp -d foo -o number-up=2 filename
